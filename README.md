### Install Jupyter Notebook
Installing Jupyter using Anaconda and conda
For new users, we highly recommend installing Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

Use the following installation steps:

Download Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). We recommend downloading Anacondaâ€™s latest Python 3 version (currently Python 3.5).

Install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the instructions on the download page.

Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook. To run the notebook:

### Install all required python packages
$pip install --upgrade tensorflow

### Clone this repository
$git clone https://github.com/angui100/ML_TensorFlow_Workshop.git

### Go to project directory

### Run Jupyter Notebook
$jupyter Notebook

### Open the Notebook file by double clicking I_love_my_cats_dogs.ipynb.

### We will go through the cell by cell running this program.

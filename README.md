Installing Jupyter using Anaconda and conda
For new users, we highly recommend installing Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

Use the following installation steps:

Download Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). We recommend downloading Anacondaâ€™s latest Python 3 version (currently Python 3.5).

Install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the instructions on the download page.

Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook. To run the notebook:

$jupyter notebook
